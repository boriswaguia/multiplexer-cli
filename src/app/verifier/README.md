Explore the model and provide some questions the developer should answers. Questions that when unanswared, are source of issues in most software. Those questions can be the following:

* What are the possible point of failure of this software ? This generally is answered by checking unspecified behaviours
* What happen if the user ('actor') perform the same task more than one time: click on the button twice
